# 🔧 Render Deployment Fix

## ✅ **Issue Resolved: Missing "build" script**

The error you encountered:
```
npm error Missing script: "build"
```

**Has been fixed!** I've added the missing build script to your `package.json`.

---

## 📋 **What I Fixed:**

### ✅ **Updated `package.json`:**
Added the missing "build" script:
```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "echo 'No build step required for Node.js server'",
  "start": "node server-new.js",
  ...
}
```

### ✅ **Updated Render Configuration:**
Made the build process more explicit in `render.json`.

---

## 🚀 **Redeploy to Render:**

### **Option 1: Automatic Redeploy**
If you have auto-deploy enabled, just push your changes to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Add missing build script for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

### **Option 2: Manual Redeploy**
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Find your service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"

---

## ⚙️ **Correct Render Settings:**

Make sure your Render service is configured with:

```
Name: staff-management-api
Region: Oregon (US West)
Branch: main
Root Directory: server              ← Important!
Runtime: Node
Build Command: npm install          ← Not "npm run build"
Start Command: node server-new.js
Auto-Deploy: Yes
```

**Environment Variables:**
```
MONGODB_URI = mongodb+srv://vs4:vs4@cluster0.q8hlybw.mongodb.net/staff_management?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
DATABASE_NAME = staff_management
NODE_ENV = production
```

---

## 🧪 **Verify Deployment:**

After redeployment, test these endpoints:
- `GET /` → Service info ✅
- `GET /api/health` → Health check ✅
- `GET /api/staff` → Staff data ✅

---

## 💡 **Why This Happened:**

Render sometimes tries to run `npm run build` by default for Node.js projects, even when no build step is needed. By adding an explicit build script that does nothing (just echoes a message), we satisfy Render's expectation while making it clear that no actual build process is required for a simple Node.js server.

**Your deployment should now work perfectly!** 🎉
